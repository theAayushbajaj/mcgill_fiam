the company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the company s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts targets or projections including achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the companys business segments 7 changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers the timing of orders and shipments emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors and industry demand fluctuations the company s expectations for both short and longterm future net revenues are based on the company s estimates of future demand orders from the company s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from endusers and enduser demand can be difficult to predict low enduser demand would negatively affect orders the company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could in turn adversely affect the company s revenues in any fiscal period if the company s estimates of sales are not accurate and the company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results the company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected because our products are primarily sold by third parties our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third party distributor could adversely affect the company s revenues a number of the company s products are sold through thirdparty distributors and large retailers some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability additionally no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the company distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the company s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the company s net revenues and profit margins the ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers fulfillment standards are subject to several factors some of which are beyond our control customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our products for specific selling seasons especially during our second and third fiscal quarters and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year we cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers vendor production delays difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are ongoing risks of our business we also rely upon thirdparty carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers accordingly we are subject to risks including labor disputes inclement weather natural disasters possible acts of terrorism availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customers or reduced orders reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the company s business the company sources its products from suppliers located in asia europe and the united states the company s asia vendors are located primarily in china which subjects the company to various risks within the region including regulatory political economic and foreign currency changes the company s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products the company s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in china labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in north america however as china is experiencing rapid social political and economic changes labor costs have risen in some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the company in china at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations in china interruption of supplies from any of the company s vendors or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on the company s business and operating results 8 changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the company and its overseas vendors in particular although the chinese renminbi has recently depreciated against the us dollar if the chinese renminbi appreciates with respect to the us dollar in the future the company may experience cost increases on such purchases and this can adversely impact profitability future interventions by china may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases additional factors that could adversely affect the company s business include increases in transportation costs new or increased import duties transportation delays work stoppages capacity constraints and poor quality the company s operations are increasingly global in nature our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations as our international operations and activities expand we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries these factors include changes generally in political regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products including government subsidies tax benefits changes in local tax rates trade actions such as antidumping proceedings and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the company changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position selling prices and manufacturing costs and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market these risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products our pricing sales volume and ultimately our financial performance the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the company vary from country to country and are unpredictable continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours in addition any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the company such as reduction in revenues increased costs lower gross margin percentages increased allowances for doubtful accounts andor writeoffs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the company s business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow financial condition or results of operations the company s business historically has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year when compared to the first and fourth quarters the company is a major supplier of products related to the backtoschool season which occurs principally during the months of may june july and august if this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the company s product line does not materialize in any year the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results our business has experienced significant historical growth over the years and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions this growth places significant demands on management and operational systems if we cannot effectively manage our growth it is likely to result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operating results to the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions 9 loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the company s future sales and earnings sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors in 2015 and 2014 the company had two customers respectively that individually exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales net sales to these customers amounted to approximately 12 for each in 2015 and 14 and 12 in 2014 the company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future the business risks associated with this concentration including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt writeoffs could negatively affect our margins and profits additionally the loss of a major customer whether through competition or consolidation or a disruption in sales to such a customer could result in a decrease of the company s future sales and earnings the loss of key management could adversely affect the company s ability to run its business the company s success depends to a large extent on the continued service of its executive management team operating officers and other key personnel the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth the company s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations failure to protect the company s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes the company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive there can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the company s products will be issued in which case the company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar andor compatible competing products if other companies were to sell similar andor compatible competing products the company s results of operations could be adversely affected furthermore there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful any infringement of the company s intellectual property or legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the company the company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes the company s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants high volume office supply stores and online the company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation quality price merchandising design and engineering capabilities product development timeliness and completeness of delivery conformity to customer specifications and postsale support competitive conditions may require the company to match or better competitors prices to retain business or market shares the company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development manufacturing and sourcing quality standards marketing and customer service and support the company s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes the company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the company may not anticipate identify develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position in addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis and new product launches may not provide expected growth results
