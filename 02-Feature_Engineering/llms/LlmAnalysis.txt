The company's risk profile is moderately high due to the presence of several significant operational, market, financial, and external risks. While some risks such as environmental regulation and data breaches have a relatively low likelihood, others such as dependence on third-party distributors and retailers, intense competition and customer service, have a higher likelihood and impact. The company's reliance on foreign suppliers and intense market competition also contribute to the overall risk profile.
